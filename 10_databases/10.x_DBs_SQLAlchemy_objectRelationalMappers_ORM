# What is SQLAlchemy used for in Python?
# SQLAlchemy is a library that facilitates the communication between Python programs and databases.
# Most of the time, this library is used as an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) tool that translates Python classes
# to tables on relational databases and automatically converts function calls to SQL statements.
