import first_module

# Basis for this little exercise was:
url = r"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sugvnHA7ElY&ab_channel=CoreySchafer"

# Note to myself: The purpose of this module is demonstration of what the expression
# 	if __name__ == '__main__':
# actually means.

# This module only works / gets understandable in combination with module 'first module'
# So go ahead and check what's the content of that one, then come back and execute 'second_module'
